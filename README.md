in this seaborn file i used seaborn datasets.
I applied  preprocessing of data  
univariate analysis
bivariate analysis --> combining two different kinds of data , two same type of data and plotting them with respective plots suitable for that data.
multivariate analysis-->more than two comparing
plotting of graphs like hist,count and kde on the numerical and categorical data
